# Discord Character Bot Platform: Final Plan

## Project Overview

An open-source alternative to commercial character bot hosting platforms, allowing users to create and deploy AI character bots on Discord using their own AI API keys.

## Architecture

## Core Components

1. **Web Portal**

   - Discord OAuth integration for user authentication
   - Character creation and management interface
   - Bot deployment and monitoring dashboard
   - User account management (including bot credits)

2. **Database (MongoDB)**

   - Self-hosted on existing VPS
   - Stores character configurations, conversation histories, and user data
   - Tracks bot creation credits for each user

3. **Bot Manager Service**

   - Central Python service to provision and manage bot instances
   - Handles health monitoring and automatic recovery
   - Coordinates proxy usage for rate limit management

4. **Individual Bot Instances**

   - Implemented with Discord.py
   - Each instance runs a specific character configuration
   - Containerized with Docker for isolation and easy management

5. **Proxy Layer**
   - Utilizes 100 proxies ($3/mo)
   - Rotates connections to avoid Discord rate limiting
   - Distributes bot connections across multiple IPs

## Implementation Technologies

- **Backend**: Python (Discord.py, Flask/FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: Simple, responsive web UI (Vue.js or React)
- **Database**: MongoDB (self-hosted)
- **Containerization**: Docker (reluctantly, but necessary for scaling)
- **Hosting**: Existing underutilized VPS

## Business Model

- **Self-hosted**: Free, open-source (users run their own infrastructure)
- **Managed hosting**: Tiered pricing model:
  - $1/mo: 1-3 bots
  - $3/mo: 4-10 bots
  - $5/mo: 11-20 bots
  - $10/mo: 21-50 bots (no unlimited tier)
- **Bot provisioning**: Manual credit allocation system initially

## Initial Development Phases

1. **Core Framework** (2-3 weeks)

   - Set up basic Discord bot framework with character configuration
   - Implement proxy rotation system
   - Create basic MongoDB schema

2. **Web Portal** (2-3 weeks)

   - Implement Discord OAuth
   - Create character management interface
   - Build user dashboard

3. **Bot Management** (3-4 weeks)

   - Develop bot provisioning system
   - Implement Docker containerization
   - Create monitoring and health check systems

4. **Polish & Launch** (2 weeks)
   - Testing and bug fixes
   - Documentation for self-hosting
   - Set up payment processing for managed hosting

## Cost Structure (Monthly)

- VPS: Already paid for (existing infrastructure)
- MongoDB: Self-hosted (minimal additional cost)
- Proxies: $3 for 100 IPs
- Misc. costs: ~$10-20 (domain, SSL, etc.)

**Total Monthly Overhead**: ~$15-25

Break-even point: Only 15-25 users at the $1/mo tier, or fewer at higher tiers.

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub repository with initial project structure
2. Create basic bot template with character configuration support
3. Implement proxy rotation system
4. Begin work on web portal with Discord OAuth
