## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations
- A Discord account with a server where you have admin permissions
- (Optional) An account on shapes.inc if you're migrating an existing character

## Migration from shapes.inc

### Step 1: Export Your Character Data

To migrate your existing character from shapes.inc, you'll need to export two JSON files:

#### 1.1 Get your shapes.json file

This contains your character's personality, appearance, and system configuration:

1. Make sure you're logged into shapes.inc
2. Visit the URL below, replacing `(YOUR_SHAPE_NAME)` with your character's name:
   ```
   https://shapes.inc/api/shapes/username/(YOUR_SHAPE_NAME)
   ```
3. The browser will display a JSON file. Press `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on Mac) to save it as `shapes.json`

#### 1.2 Get your brain.json file

This contains your character's knowledge base:

1. You'll need to find your character's unique ID, which is NOT the Discord bot ID
2. The unique ID can be found in one of two ways:

   - **Method 1**: Look in your `shapes.json` file for the ID under the `free_will_v2_ff` property (use Ctrl+F to find it)
   - **Method 2**: Your character's URL pattern contains the ID. If you visit:
     ```
     https://shapes.inc/YOUR_SHAPE_NAME/readme
     ```
     You can extract the ID from there

3. Once you have the unique ID, visit:
   ```
   https://shapes.inc/api/shapes/(YOUR_SHAPE_UNIQUE_ID)/story
   ```
4. Save this file as `brain.json` using `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`

### Step 2: Keep These Files Safe

Store your `shapes.json` and `brain.json` files in a folder where you'll run the migration parser. These files contain all your character's data.

## Setting Up Your Discord Bot

### Step 1: Create a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click the "New Application" button in the top right
3. Give your application a name (this will be your bot's initial username)
4. Click "Create"

### Step 2: Set Up the Bot User

1. In the left sidebar, click on "Bot"
2. Click the "Add Bot" button and confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!"
3. Under the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section, enable ALL three toggles:
   - Presence Intent
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent
4. Click on "Reset Token" and copy your bot token
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Keep this token secure! Anyone with this token can control your bot
   - Consider saving it in a password manager or secure note
5. Disable "Public Bot" if you want to prevent others from inviting your bot to their servers

### Step 3: Invite Your Bot to Your Server

1. In the left sidebar, click on "OAuth2" and then "URL Generator"
2. Under "Scopes", check "bot"
3. Under "Bot Permissions", select the following:
   - Read Messages/View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Manage Messages
   - Embed Links
   - Attach Files
   - Read Message History
   - Add Reactions
   - Use Slash Commands
4. Copy the generated URL at the bottom of the page
5. Paste the URL in a new browser tab
6. Select the server where you want to add the bot
7. Click "Authorize" and complete any verification steps

## Running the Migration Parser

### Step 1: Set Up the Parser

1. The migration parser script (`parser.py`) is already included in the `openshapes/selfhost` directory
2. Place your `shapes.json` and `brain.json` files in this same directory

### Step 2: Run the Parser

1. Open a command prompt or terminal in the folder containing your files
2. Run the parser with:
   ```bash
   python parser.py
   ```
3. When prompted, enter the paths to your files:
   - For `shapes.json`, either enter the full path or just press Enter if it's in the current directory
   - For `brain.json`, either enter the full path or just press Enter if it's in the current directory
   - For the output directory, either specify a path or press Enter to use the current directory

### Step 3: Check the Output

The parser will generate:

- `character_config.json` in your output directory
- A `character_data` folder containing:
  - `memory.json`
  - `lorebook.json`

These files contain all the information needed for your OpenShape.

## Configuring and Starting the Bot

### Step 1: Install the OpenShapes Bot

1. Clone the OpenShapes repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zukijourney/openshapes.git
   cd openshapes/selfhost
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Your Bot

1. Open the generated `character_config.json` file in a text editor
2. Add your Discord bot token to the `"bot_token"` field:
   ```json
   "bot_token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
   ```
3. Configure the `"owner_id"` field with your Discord user ID
4. Customize other settings as desired:
   - `"character_name"`: Your character's display name
   - `"command_prefix"`: The prefix for commands (default is `/`)
   - `"always_reply_mentions"`: Whether the bot responds to mentions
   - `"use_tts"`: Whether the bot uses text-to-speech for responses

### Step 3: Check Configuration Files

The parser generates the configuration files directly in the correct directory:

- `character_config.json` should be in the `openshapes/selfhost` directory
- `character_data` folder should be in the `openshapes/selfhost` directory

Ensure these files are in place before continuing.

### Step 4: Start the Bot

From the `openshapes/selfhost` directory, run:

```bash
python bot.py
```

Your OpenShape should now be online in your Discord server!

## AI API Configuration

### Step 1: Choose an AI Provider

OpenShapes supports multiple AI providers. Configure your preferred provider using the `/api_settings` command in Discord:

1. Type `/api_settings` in a Discord channel where your bot has access
2. The bot will guide you through setting up:
   - API provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, ZukiAI, etc.)
   - API key
   - Model selection
   - Optional: TTS voice configuration

### Step 2: Default API Settings

If you don't change the settings, the default configuration in your `character_config.json` is:

```json
"api_settings": {
    "base_url": "https://api.zukijourney.com/v1",
    "api_key": "zu-myballs",
    "chat_model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "tts_model": "speechify",
    "tts_voice": "mrbeast"
}
```

Since the OpenShapes project originated from the ZukiJourney community (https://zukijourney.com), their API is set as the default, but you're encouraged to:

- Use any AI API provider of your choice
- Look for free or affordable options on [CAS ZukiJourney](https://cas.zukijourney.com)

You should definitely change these settings to use your own API keys.

## Character Commands and Features

Your OpenShape comes with several commands and features as shown in the help guide:

### Basic Interaction

- In activated channels: The bot responds to all messages automatically
- In other channels: Mention the bot (@BotName) or use its name in your message
